# Crackhead code

Fun part of the programming realm. Type of coding you do when you're drunk, high or in academia and the grants are fat. When someone asks you why you did a project that fits this category, you respond "because fuck you, that's why". Writing C compiler in Ruby, web app in assembly, stuff like that.
