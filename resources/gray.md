# Gray area

All those nasty things you wanted to know but haven't had the cojones to ask. Gray area resources, mostly related to (un)ethical hacking, malware development, social engineering and other fun things we all wanted to do after watching Hackers (1995) with Angelina Jolie. Or Mr. Robot, for younger audience.
